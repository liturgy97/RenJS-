# RenJSâ‚—áµ¢â‚œ â€“ A Visual Novel Framework Inspired by Ren'Py

Hi, I'm **Liturgy**, the creator of **RenJSâ‚—áµ¢â‚œ**.

RenJSâ‚—áµ¢â‚œ is a JavaScript framework that brings Renpy's signature style to **static HTML visual novels**. What sets it apart is its ability to **interpret Ren'Py screenplay script** within backticks to seamlessly display scenes.

The framework is already advanced enough for my needs, with **rollback as the only critical missing feature**â€”currently in development and soon to be implemented.

## ðŸŽ¨ RenJSâ‚—áµ¢â‚œ VSCode Extension

A companion **VSCode extension** is also in development to streamline the scripting process.

### âœ… Current Features:

- **Label jump** (Hold `Ctrl` to navigate)
- **Highlighting unclosed quotes**
- **Character name colorization**

### ðŸš€ Upcoming Features:

- **Better formatting** within backticks
- **Auto-indentation**
